Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Shanthi Nagasubramanian
Divide and Conquer Algorithms
Break the problem into different pieces to reduce the complexity and put the results back to get to the final
solution. This is done in cases where the problem is complex and also where straight single approach does not work. For Example: quicksort
